        <p>hello folks we are room 2 a band from invercargill new zealand.<br>
        we started as a 3 man band consisting of alex (guitar), kaden (drums) <br>
        and fabian (rhythm) then later recruiting will when he showed a interest <br> 
        in playing bass. from there we started trying to do covers of songs until <br>
        we started work on our first original song due to hopefully come out late 2023.<br>
